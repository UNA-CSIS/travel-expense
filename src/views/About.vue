    <p class="text-center">UNIVERSITY OF NORTH ALABAMA TRAVEL POLICY</p>

    <p class="text-sm-left">
      The travel policies of the University of North Alabama have been developed
      in accordance with Alabama law and Internal Revenue Service regulations
      and guidelines. These policies cover University employees, students and
      others who travel on approved, official University business.
    </p>

    <p class="text-sm-left">
      At a minimum, employees must obtain prior approval of the immediate
      supervisor before traveling or obligating University funds. Some types of
      travel require additional authorization.
    </p>

    <p class="text-sm-left">
      When traveling at the University of North Alabama’s expense, University
      employees should, in all cases, seek to obtain the lowest possible fares
      and rates by scheduling their travel in a manner that will be the most
      economical to the University. Personal travel for side trips is not
      reimbursed. It is the employee’s responsibility to obtain proper
      documentation of the travel costs when seeking reimbursement for incurred
      expenses.
    </p>

    <p class="text-sm-left">
      In all cases, there must be a clear, documented business purpose for
      travel. Excessive or unjustifiable costs are not acceptable and will not
      be paid by or reimbursed from university funds
    </p>
    <p class="text-center">GENERAL</p>

    <p class="text-sm-left">
      Travel Status - Employees are in travel status when they leave their base.
      Base is defined as the employees’ primary residence or work location
      whichever is closest to the travel destination. Work location is defined
      as the office location to which an employee is assigned.
    </p>

    <p class="text-sm-left">
      Claim for Travel Expenses – Claim forms for In-State/Out-of-State Travel
      Expenses are used to record all reimbursable employee travel costs and
      note university paid travel costs. All claims for travel reimbursement
      must be made on an In-State or Outof-State travel form. These forms are
      located at http://www.una.edu/controller/index.html. Requests for
      reimbursement should be submitted within sixty (60) days after completion
      of the trip. Original itemized receipts and other documentation of the
      total costs of the trip must be submitted along with the claim form. When
      a trip includes both in-state and out-of-state travel, the entire trip
      should be reported on the out-of-state travel form with actual
      expenditures claimed. If the claim form is submitted more than 60 days
      after the traveler’s return, the reimbursement may become taxable income
      to the employee. Federal tax regulations require that substantiation of
      reimbursed expenses be made within a reasonable period. Under IRS
      safe-harbor guidelines, that period is 60 days. Tax withholding will be
      made from a subsequent salary payment. The form must be signed on the line
      marked “Traveler’s Signature” by the employee who traveled and is seeking
      reimbursement. The employee’s signature acknowledges acceptance and terms
      of reimbursement. Any expenses covered by the university or a third party
      should be noted on the travel form to provide clarity of the entire trip
      expense.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm-left">
      Documentation of Costs/Approval of Travel Reimbursement - After returning
      from official travel, employees are required to present original itemized
      receipts for all actual travel expenses for which a claim is made. See
      In-State and Out of State Guidelines. Conference registration fees paid by
      a participating University employee are reimbursable following the
      conference. To claim reimbursement, any conference brochures or other
      literature documenting the expense, a registration receipt, including
      dollar amount and method of payment, or other proof of payment must be
      submitted along with the claim for travel form.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm-left">
      Approval of Travel Reimbursement by Supervisor, Dean, Director or
      Department Head -The University requires that claims from University
      Travel Expense Forms be signed by the supervisor (not a designee or stamp)
      of the employee who is requesting reimbursement for official travel. By
      signing the reimbursement form, the supervisor is certifying the expenses
      have been used in accordance with the University of North Alabama’s Travel
      Policies. Even when the traveler is the principal investigator or project
      director of a grant, the claim for travel reimbursement must be signed by
      his/her supervisor. Deans and department heads may establish more, but not
      less, restrictive policies than what is required by the university, as
      reimbursement approval from budgets for which they are responsible..
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm-left">
      Exceptions –Generally, any exception to University travel policies should
      have prior written authorization from the appropriate Dean or Executive
      Council Member and the University Controller. Rules promulgated by the
      State of Alabama have precedence.

      .These forms must be signed by the principal investigator or project
      director officially responsible for the contract or grant account; this
      person may not defer this responsibility to anyone else. In addition, the
      appropriate travel form must be signed by the investigator’s or project
      director’s supervisor. All Reimbursement will be subject to the
      University’s policies, unless the contract or grant prohibits
